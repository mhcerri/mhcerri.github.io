      <description>Linux containers (LXC) is a lightweight method of virtualization at the operating system level. In a sentence it&amp;rsquo;s a chroot on steroids providing resources (CPU, memory, etc) isolation thanks to cgroups.
Install the necessary packages To start with Linux containers, install the following packages:
# On ArchLinux pacman -S lxc arch-install-scripts lxc-checkconfig # On Fedora dnf install lxc lxc-extra lxc-templates Configure the network In this example, containers will be created by default with a ethernet pair device connected to a bridge.</description>

      <description>Note: I&amp;rsquo;m currently using a Raspberry Pi 2 and Arch Linux ARM
My first attempt to set up a mini home server was using a Raspberry Pi as a torrent and a DLNA server running with an external HDD. Unfortunately it had a lot of USB related issues that caused the HDD and the network to disconnect very often. I tried several workarounds, from tweaks in the boot-loader to fixes in the kernel without success.</description>

      <description>NetworkManager makes network configuration easy and simple, but it also provides some cool features to specific scenarios.
I use rygel in my small home server to stream videos to other devices in my local network. Currently this home server is connect to my network via wifi (I&amp;rsquo;m using a cheap android stick with linux as my home server and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have an ethernet interface) and eventually the wifi connection can drop.</description>

      <title>Installing Python from sources</title>

      <description>Python is present in a large number of distros today and in fact most distros have at least one or more core components that are written or extensible using Python.
That is a good thing in the way that you can write Python application without any need to worry if Python will be available or not for ditro A or distro B. But it also creates some problems.
Not all python modules are available via the distro package manager There are thousands of modules and libraries available for Python, several of them are constantly updated.</description>
